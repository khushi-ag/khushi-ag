PARTITION BY gives aggregated columns with each record in the specified table. PARTITION BY does not affect the number of rows returned, but it changes how a window function's result is calculated.
 
A GROUP BY normally reduces the number of rows returned by rolling them up and calculating averages or sums for each row. 

Row_Number() will generate a unique number for every row, even if one or more rows has the same value.

RANK() will assign the same number for the row which contains the same value and skips the next number.

DENSE_RANK () will assign the same number for the row which contains the same value without skipping the next number.
